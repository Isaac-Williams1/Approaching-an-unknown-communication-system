**Abstract:**
> <p align="justify"> <i> This paper proposes a methodology for discovering meaningful properties in data by exploring the latent space of unsupervised deep generative models. We combine manipulation of individual latent variables to extreme values with methods inspired by causal inference into an approach we call causal disentanglement with extreme values (CDEV) and show that this method yields insights for model interpretability. With this, we can infer what properties of unknown data the model encodes as meaningful, using it to glean insight into the communication system of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), one of the most intriguing and understudied animal communication systems. The network architecture used has been shown to learn meaningful representations of speech; here, it is used as a learning mechanism to decipher the properties of another vocal communication system in which case we have no ground truth. The proposed methodology suggests that sperm whales encode information using the number of clicks in a sequence, the regularity of their timing, and audio properties such as the spectral mean and the acoustic regularity of the sequences. Some of these findings are consistent with existing hypotheses, while others are proposed for the first time. We also argue that our models uncover rules that govern the structure of  units in the communication system and apply them while generating innovative data not shown during training. This paper suggests that an interpretation of the outputs of deep neural networks with causal inference methodology can be a viable strategy for approaching data about which little is known and presents another case of how deep learning can limit the hypothesis space. Finally, the proposed approach can be extended to arbitrary architectures and datasets.</i></p>



## Requirements

<!-- TODO: add the analysis ones, too -->
To install requirements for 

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```




## The `fiwGAN` model

The `fiwGAN` architecture implementation in `pytorch` is located in [ciwfiwgan](ciwfiwgan).  



Unfortunately, the data is not free to share; the training parameters, however, were the following:
```train
python train.py --fiw --num_categ 5 --datadir training_directory --logdir log_directory\
--num_epochs 8000 --slice_len 65536
```

Add `--cont last` to the end of the training statement to continue from the last found state  
Add `--cont epoch_number` to continue from the state corresponding to `epoch_number`


>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.


### Trained Model

<!-- TODO: hyperparam / script -->

The trained model used to generate results can be obtained here and loaded with 

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 


#### Compute resources used for model training

<!-- Compute: Did you include the amount of compute and the type of resources used (e.g., type of GPUs, internal cluster, or cloud provider)? Ideally, you would provide the compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as the total compute. Note that your full research project might have required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper). Enter yes, no, n/a, or an explanation if appropriate. Answers are visible to reviewers.

    Authors are encouraged to provide as much information as practical about the type and amount of compute used for experiments. The total compute used for all experiments may be harder to characterize, but if you can do that, that would be even better. -->


The model was trained across approximately 3 days on a single Nvidia 1080Ti (11 GB GPU memory) on a cluster-based instance running on Intel Xeon E5-2623.


## Analysis

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).



#### Compute resources used for data generation and analysis

The data generation was done in parallel via four Nvidia T4 GPUs on an `g4dn.12xlarge` AWS instance, taking about a day for each of the two outcome types presented: click number and spacing, and audio properties.

The analysis of those outcomes and the generation of the results was then done locally.





## Results
